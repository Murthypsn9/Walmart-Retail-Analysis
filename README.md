Walmart Retail Analysis
In this project we focused retail analysis with Walmart data and answer the following questions:

Which stores have maximum and sales?
Which store has maximum standard deviation i.e., the sales vary a lot?. Also, find out the coefficient of mean to standard deviation.
Which store/s has good quarterly growth rate in Q3â€™2012?
Find out holidays which have higher sales than the mean sales in non-holiday season for all stores together.
Provide a monthly and semester view of sales in units and give insights.
Build prediction to forecast demand.
In this project, we used RandomForestRegressor and LinearRegression to predict of sales. The data have been split into training and testing with a ratio of 80:20.
